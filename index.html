             <p> I am a ESSEC student, I'm from Brittany, and I love running, reading and my cats. I am very curious, and I like to learn, especially programming with le Wagon </p>

             <h2> Running <i class="fa-solid fa-person-running"></i></h2>
             <p> I discovered the joys of running during containment with my father, and now, I run three or four times a week. My goal is to participate in the Paris solidarity marathon at the end of the year 2023.</p>

             <h2> Reading <i class="fa-solid fa-book"></i></h2> 
             <p> I've loved reading since I was a little girl, and still today I devour books with passion. I really like crime novels, my favorite is "fils de personne" by Jean-Fran√ßois Pasques. I also enjoy the political, economic and historical essays. </p>
